I'm a student from Kerala who believes in the power of science and data. Currently learning Physics, Data Science and Programming. I began my journey in physical sciences and now dreams of becoming a data scientist. I code primarily in Python. In my free time i mostly listen to music, engage in reading a book or maybe watch a movie. Though not a good player, i also finds time to play football/ badminton when I'm free.
